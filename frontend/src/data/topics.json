    "level": "Beginner",
    "category": "Binary Search",
    "content": [
      "Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array. Unlike linear search which checks each element one by one taking O(n) time, binary search repeatedly divides the search space in half, achieving O(log n) time complexity. This means searching in an array of 1 million elements takes only about 20 comparisons instead of potentially 1 million. The key requirement is that the array must be sorted beforehand.",
      "The algorithm works by maintaining three pointers: left, right, and mid. Initially, left points to the first index and right to the last. In each iteration, you calculate mid as the middle index between left and right, then compare the element at mid with your target. If they match, you found the answer. If the target is smaller, you know it must be in the left half, so you move right to mid - 1. If the target is larger, it must be in the right half, so you move left to mid + 1. This process continues until you find the target or the search space becomes empty.",
      "A common pitfall is calculating the middle index. Using mid = (left + right) / 2 can cause integer overflow when left and right are large numbers. The safer formula is mid = left + (right - left) / 2, which avoids overflow. Another critical detail is the loop condition: while (left <= right) ensures you don't miss the case where the target is at the exact position where left and right meet. If you use while (left < right), you might exit one iteration too early.",
      "Binary search returns different values based on the problem. For finding exact matches, return the index when found or -1 if not found. For finding insertion positions (where to insert a target in sorted order), return left after the loop ends. For finding first/last occurrence of duplicates, you modify the algorithm to continue searching even after finding a match. These variations make binary search versatile for many problems beyond simple searching.",
      "Real-world applications include searching in databases (indexed columns use binary search trees), dictionaries and phone books (alphabetically sorted), version control systems (finding when a bug was introduced by searching through commits), and even optimizing machine learning hyperparameters (searching for the best learning rate). Any time you have sorted data and need fast lookup, binary search is the go-to technique.",
      "To master binary search, practice on arrays with odd and even lengths, arrays with duplicate elements, and edge cases like single-element arrays or searching for values outside the array bounds. Visualizing the search space shrinking helps build intuition. Always verify your loop invariants: what does left represent? What does right represent? Are they inclusive or exclusive bounds? Clear thinking about these prevents off-by-one errors."

      "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized binary tree where each node follows a strict ordering property: all values in the left subtree are smaller than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater. This ordering enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with O(log n) time complexity in balanced trees. For example, in a BST with root 8, left subtree might contain [3,1,6] and right subtree [10,14].",
      "Searching in a BST leverages the ordering property by comparing the target value with the current node. If the target is smaller, search the left subtree; if larger, search the right. This binary decision at each node eliminates half the remaining nodes, similar to binary search on sorted arrays. A search for value 6 in tree [8,3,10,1,6,14] would go: 8→3→6 (found), requiring only 3 comparisons instead of checking all nodes.",
      "Insertion maintains BST property by finding the correct leaf position. Start at root, compare with target: go left if smaller, right if larger. When reaching null, insert the new node there. Inserting 7 into [8,3,10,1,6,14] follows path 8→3→6→right, creating new node. Duplicate values are typically handled by storing frequency counts or rejecting insertion based on requirements.",
      "Deletion is the most complex BST operation with three cases: (1) Deleting a leaf node - simply remove it. (2) Node with one child - replace it with its child. (3) Node with two children - replace with inorder successor (smallest node in right subtree) or inorder predecessor (largest in left subtree), then delete that successor/predecessor node. This maintains BST property throughout the tree.",
      "BST validation requires checking that for every node, all left descendants are smaller and all right descendants are larger. A common mistake is only checking immediate children. Use inorder traversal (which produces sorted output in valid BSTs) or recursive validation with min-max bounds.

Path Sum problems ask if a root-to-leaf path exists with a specific sum by subtracting each node's value from the target while traversing. For tree [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2], checking path sum 22 would traverse 5→4→11→2, accumulating values to verify the sum matches.",

For each node, the potential diameter through it equals the sum of heights of its left and right subtrees. Calculate this for all nodes and return the maximum. For tree [1,2,3,4,5], diameter is 3 (path 4→2→1→3 or 5→2→1→3), even though it passes through root.",

For tree [3,5,1,6,2,0,8], LCA(5,1) = 3 (root), but LCA(5,2) = 5 (ancestor can be one of the nodes itself).",

Given preorder and inorder, preorder's first element is root; find it in inorder to split left/right subtrees, then recursively build each subtree.

A graph can be directed (edges have direction) or undirected (connections are bidirectional), and weighted (edges have costs) or unweighted.",

Most graph algorithms including DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's work naturally with adjacency lists.",

Use adjacency matrices when you need fast edge lookups or the graph is dense. Use edge lists when you only need to iterate all edges or the graph is very sparse. In coding interviews, adjacency lists are standard - graphs are typically given as arrays where index represents node and value is list of neighbors."

Unlike BFS which works only for unweighted graphs (or treats all edges as weight 1), Dijkstra handles varying edge costs. The algorithm maintains a set of visited nodes and repeatedly selects the unvisited node with the smallest known distance, then updates distances to its neighbors. For graph with edges [(A,B,4), (A,C,2), (C,B,1)], the shortest path A→B is A→C→B with total weight 3, not the direct edge A→B with weight 4.",

Initialize all distances to infinity except source (distance 0). While priority queue is not empty: extract node u with minimum distance, mark it visited, then for each neighbor v of u, if distance[u] + weight(u,v) < distance[v], update distance[v] and parent[v]. This relaxation step is key - we constantly try to find better paths. The priority queue ensures we process nodes in order of increasing distance from source.",

Each vertex is extracted once from the priority queue (O(V log V)), and each edge causes a potential distance update and priority queue operation (O(E log V)). Space complexity is O(V) for distance array, parent array, and priority queue. With a Fibonacci heap, complexity improves to O(E + V log V), but implementation is complex. For dense graphs where E ≈ V², using an array for finding minimum (O(V²)) can be faster than priority queue.",

It requires non-negative edge weights - negative weights break the greedy approach because a shorter path might be found after marking a node as visited. For graphs with negative weights, use Bellman-Ford algorithm instead. Dijkstra works on both directed and undirected graphs. To reconstruct the shortest path, maintain a parent array tracking the previous node in the optimal path. Backtrack from destination through parents to source, then reverse. The algorithm naturally handles disconnected graphs - unreachable nodes retain infinite distance.",

This models tasks with dependencies: if task A must be completed before task B, we draw an edge A→B, and topological sort gives a valid task execution order. For courses with prerequisites, topological sort tells you which order to take classes. Example: for edges [0→1, 0→2, 1→3, 2→3], valid orders include [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]. Topological sort only exists for DAGs - graphs with cycles have no valid ordering.",

DFS approach performs depth-first search and adds nodes to result after visiting all descendants, then reverses the result. When exploring a node, recursively visit all neighbors first, then add current node to a stack. The stack naturally contains nodes in reverse topological order - nodes with no outgoing edges appear first, then nodes depending on them. Time complexity is O(V + E) visiting each vertex and edge once. This approach is elegant and naturally detects cycles using recursion stack.",
      "Kahn's algorithm is BFS-based and more intuitive for dependency problems. Calculate in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex. Vertices with in-degree 0 have no dependencies and can be processed first. Initialize queue with all zero in-degree vertices. While queue is not empty: dequeue vertex, add to result, then for each neighbor, decrease its in-degree by 1 (removing the processed dependency). If neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, enqueue it. If result contains all vertices, topological order exists; otherwise graph has a cycle. Time O(V + E), space O(V).",

In Kahn's algorithm, if you process fewer than V vertices, remaining vertices are stuck in a cycle with no zero in-degree vertices. Course Schedule problems on LeetCode are classic topological sort applications: Course Schedule checks if completion is possible (cycle detection), Course Schedule II returns the actual course order (topological ordering).",

      "Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and reusing their solutions instead of recomputing them. It is especially useful in optimization and counting problems where a naive recursive solution repeatedly solves the same subproblems, leading to exponential time. DP usually reduces such solutions to polynomial time by caching or tabulating results.",
      "Two key properties make a problem a good candidate for DP: optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Optimal substructure means the optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. Overlapping subproblems means the same subproblems are solved multiple times in a naive recursion, so caching them can save work.",
      "A classic example is the Fibonacci sequence, where fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) with base cases fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1. A naive recursive implementation recomputes the same fib(k) many times, leading to a time complexity of roughly O(2^n). With dynamic programming, we compute each fib(k) once and reuse stored results, reducing the complexity to O(n).",
      "There are two primary approaches to dynamic programming: top-down with memoization and bottom-up with tabulation. In the top-down approach, you start with the original problem and recursively solve subproblems, storing answers in a cache (memo). In the bottom-up approach, you iteratively build a table from the smallest subproblems up to the original one, carefully choosing an order so that dependencies are already computed.",
      "Memoization (top-down DP) wraps a normal recursive solution with a cache like an array or dictionary. When a recursive call is made for a subproblem, you first check if its result is already in the cache; if so, you return it immediately instead of recomputing. This keeps the code close to the mathematical recurrence and is often easier to write and debug when learning DP.",
      "Tabulation (bottom-up DP) builds a table iteratively, usually using loops. For Fibonacci, you can create an array dp where dp[i] stores fib(i), set the base cases like dp[0] and dp[1], and then fill the array from i = 2 to n using the relation dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]. Tabulation avoids recursion and can be more memory-efficient when combined with techniques like only storing the last few states.",
      "Choosing between memoization and tabulation depends on the problem and your goals. Memoization is usually easier to derive from a recursive definition, but it uses the call stack and may have overhead from recursive calls. Tabulation can be faster in practice and gives you more control over iteration order and space optimizations, but it requires you to think explicitly about the correct filling order of the DP table.",
      "Beyond Fibonacci, DP appears in many real-world scenarios such as path counting in grids, minimizing costs in scheduling, and optimizing resource allocation. For example, computing the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right of a grid from the top-left can be solved by defining dp[i][j] as the minimum cost to reach cell (i, j) and building the table row by row or column by column.",
      "When approaching any DP problem, a useful checklist is: identify the state, define the recurrence, choose between memoization and tabulation, set base cases, and determine time and space complexity. The state is what uniquely identifies a subproblem, often an index, pair of indices, or a combination of index and capacity or sum. The recurrence defines how the answer for one state depends on smaller states.",
      "As you practice DP, you will begin to recognize common patterns such as 1D sequence DP, 2D grid DP, knapsack-style subset DP, and DP on strings. Building intuition around these patterns helps you quickly map new problems to familiar templates. In AlgoSort, use the visualizer for this topic to see how subproblems are reused and how a DP table fills step by step for Fibonacci and a small grid path example."

Unlike the basic Fibonacci example, these problems involve real-world choices: should you climb 1 or 2 steps? Should you rob this house or skip it? The key is defining a state that captures your position and building a recurrence based on the choices available at that position.",
      "The general template for 1D sequence DP is: define dp[i] as the optimal solution (max/min value, count, etc.) up to index i, then express dp[i] in terms of previous states like dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]. For example, in Climbing Stairs, dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach step i, and since you can arrive from step i-1 (climb 1) or step i-2 (climb 2), the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], identical to Fibonacci but with a different real-world interpretation.",

At each house, you face a choice: rob it (gaining nums[i] + dp[i-2]) or skip it (keeping dp[i-1]). The recurrence becomes dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2]), demonstrating how DP captures trade-offs between conflicting constraints. This pattern extends to many scheduling and selection problems.",
      "Min Cost Climbing Stairs adds a cost array where each step has a cost, and you can start from step 0 or 1, aiming to reach the top with minimum cost. The recurrence is dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]), showing that you add the current cost to the cheaper of the two previous paths. This variant teaches how DP handles optimization with weighted choices, common in resource allocation and pathfinding problems.",
      "A powerful optimization technique in 1D DP is space reduction. Notice that dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], not the entire history. Instead of maintaining an array of size n, you can use just two variables (prev1, prev2) and update them in a rolling fashion. This reduces space complexity from O(n) to O(1) while keeping the same O(n) time complexity. Many interview problems expect this optimization as a follow-up question.",

The mental model is always: identify what state you need to track, determine the choices at each step, write the recurrence combining those choices, set base cases, and decide between tabulation and memoization. Practicing these core problems builds intuition for recognizing similar structures in new problems.",
      "When debugging 1D DP solutions, trace through small examples manually. For Climbing Stairs with n=5, write out dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2, dp[3]=3, dp[4]=5, dp[5]=8 and verify each step follows the recurrence. For House Robber with nums=[2,7,9,3,1], check dp=[2,7,11,11,12] and confirm why dp[2]=11 (rob house 0 and 2) and dp[3]=11 (skipping house 3 is better). Visualizing the decision tree or DP table makes these patterns concrete.",

Use the visualizer in AlgoSort to step through examples and see exactly when each state is computed and how choices propagate through the array.",

      "Knapsack problems represent a fundamental class of optimization problems where you must make binary decisions (take or leave) for each item while respecting a constraint like weight capacity or target sum. The classic 0/1 Knapsack asks: given items with weights and values and a knapsack with capacity W, what is the maximum value you can carry without exceeding the capacity? Unlike 1D sequence DP, knapsack introduces a second dimension to track both the current item index and remaining capacity.",
      "The state definition for 0/1 Knapsack is dp[i][w] representing the maximum value achievable using the first i items with capacity w. At each item i, you face a choice: skip it (keeping dp[i-1][w]) or take it if it fits (gaining value[i] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i]]). The recurrence is dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], value[i] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i]] if weight[i] <= w). This creates a 2D table where each cell depends on the row above it, making it a bottom-up tabulation problem.",
      "Building the DP table requires careful initialization: dp[0][w] = 0 for all w (no items means zero value) and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (zero capacity means nothing fits). You then fill the table row by row from item 1 to n and column by column from capacity 1 to W. The final answer is dp[n][W], representing all items considered with full capacity. Tracing back through the table can reconstruct which items were selected by checking where decisions changed.",
      "Subset Sum is a decision variant of knapsack where all items have weight equal to value, and you ask: can you select items that sum exactly to a target? Here dp[i][sum] is a boolean indicating whether you can achieve sum using the first i items. The recurrence becomes dp[i][sum] = dp[i-1][sum] OR dp[i-1][sum - nums[i]], meaning you can reach sum if either you could reach it without item i, or you could reach sum - nums[i] and then add item i. This pattern extends to Partition Equal Subset Sum and Target Sum problems.",
      "Space optimization for knapsack problems is possible because each row only depends on the previous row. Instead of a 2D array of size n × W, you can use a 1D array of size W and update it in reverse order (from W down to 0) to avoid overwriting values you still need. This reduces space complexity from O(n × W) to O(W) while keeping the same O(n × W) time complexity. The reverse iteration is critical: forward iteration would use already-updated values from the current iteration instead of the previous row.",
      "Unbounded Knapsack is a variant where you can take each item unlimited times. The only change is updating the DP array in forward order instead of reverse, because you want to reuse the current row's values (allowing multiple uses of the same item). The recurrence remains similar but now references dp[w - weight[i]] from the same row. This pattern applies to Coin Change II (counting ways) and Coin Change (minimizing coins) problems, both classic unbounded knapsack applications.",
      "Real-world applications of knapsack DP are everywhere: resource allocation with budget constraints, portfolio optimization selecting investments, cutting stock to minimize waste, project selection maximizing ROI under time limits, and even data compression choosing which data to keep. The binary decision framework (include/exclude) maps naturally to many business and engineering problems where you must optimize under constraints.",
      "When implementing knapsack DP, watch for common pitfalls: forgetting to check if item fits before taking it (weight[i] <= w condition), iterating in the wrong order for space optimization, and off-by-one errors in array indexing since dp often uses 1-indexed items but arrays are 0-indexed. Always validate with small examples like 3 items with known optimal solutions before scaling up. The visualizer in AlgoSort shows exactly how the 2D table fills and how the choice at each cell depends on cells above and to the left.",
      "Advanced knapsack variations include: bounded knapsack (limited quantity per item), multi-dimensional knapsack (multiple constraints like weight and volume), and knapsack with dependencies (some items require others). But mastering 0/1 and unbounded knapsack first gives you the foundation to tackle these extensions. The core idea of tracking state in multiple dimensions and making optimal local choices that compose into a global optimum remains constant across all variants.",
      "As you practice knapsack problems, focus on recognizing the pattern: whenever you see binary choices with cumulative constraints or targets, think knapsack. The items might be numbers to sum, jobs to schedule, or features to select, but the DP structure is the same. Building intuition for how the 2D table represents all possible states and how choices propagate through it will make even complex knapsack variants feel approachable."

      "String dynamic programming deals with problems where you compare, align, or transform two sequences (usually strings). The most fundamental pattern is defining dp[i][j] to represent some property of the first i characters of string A and the first j characters of string B. This creates a 2D table where you build up solutions character by character, making local decisions based on whether characters match or differ. String DP appears in bioinformatics (DNA sequence alignment), natural language processing (spell check, autocorrect), and version control (diff algorithms).",
      "Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) asks: what is the longest sequence of characters that appears in both strings in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively? For example, LCS of 'abcde' and 'ace' is 'ace' with length 3. The state dp[i][j] represents the LCS length of A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. If A[i-1] == B[j-1], they contribute to the LCS, so dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]. If they differ, take the best from excluding one character: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]). This simple recurrence captures the essence of sequence alignment.",
      "Building the LCS table requires initializing dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = 0 (empty string has LCS length 0 with anything). You then fill row by row, and each cell depends only on cells above, to the left, and diagonally above-left. The final answer is dp[m][n] where m and n are the string lengths. Backtracking through the table can reconstruct the actual LCS string by following the path of matching characters, though many problems only ask for the length.",
      "Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) measures the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) to transform string A into string B. This is more complex than LCS because you have three choices at each step instead of two. The state dp[i][j] represents the edit distance between A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. If A[i-1] == B[j-1], no operation is needed: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. Otherwise, consider three options: replace (dp[i-1][j-1] + 1), delete from A (dp[i-1][j] + 1), or insert into A (dp[i][j-1] + 1), and take the minimum.",
      "The initialization for Edit Distance is different from LCS: dp[i][0] = i (need i deletions to reduce A[0..i-1] to empty) and dp[0][j] = j (need j insertions to build B[0..j-1] from empty). This reflects the cost of transforming between a string and an empty string. The recurrence carefully considers all three edit operations, making it a classic example of DP with multiple transition choices. Understanding why each operation corresponds to a specific cell (diagonal for replace, left for insert, up for delete) is key to mastering this pattern.",
      "Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) is a variation where you find the longest subsequence of a single string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Interestingly, LPS of string S is equivalent to the LCS of S and its reverse. This shows how string DP problems often reduce to each other. You can also solve LPS directly with dp[i][j] representing the LPS length in substring S[i..j], where the recurrence depends on whether S[i] == S[j]. These transformations between problem formulations are powerful tools for solving new string DP variants.",
      "Space optimization for string DP is similar to knapsack: each row depends only on the previous row, so you can use two 1D arrays and alternate between them, or even a single array with careful updating. For LCS and Edit Distance, you can reduce space from O(m × n) to O(min(m, n)) by making the shorter string define the DP array dimension. This is especially important when comparing very long strings like DNA sequences or large text files, where memory can be a bottleneck.",
      "Real-world applications of string DP are everywhere: spell checkers use Edit Distance to find closest dictionary words, version control systems use LCS to compute diffs between file versions, plagiarism detectors compare document subsequences, and bioinformatics tools align protein or DNA sequences to find evolutionary relationships. The abstraction of comparing two sequences generalizes beyond strings to any ordered data: time series, event logs, or even user behavior sequences.",
      "When implementing string DP, be careful with indexing: dp[i][j] typically represents strings up to index i-1 and j-1 (1-indexed DP array, 0-indexed strings). Always verify base cases and the recurrence with small examples like 'ab' and 'ac' before scaling up. The visualizer in AlgoSort shows how the DP table fills diagonally and how matching characters create paths through the table, making the abstract recurrence concrete and intuitive.",
      "Advanced string DP includes problems like Distinct Subsequences (count occurrences of a pattern), Interleaving Strings (check if one string is formed by interleaving two others), and Wildcard Matching (pattern matching with * and ? wildcards). But mastering LCS and Edit Distance first gives you the mental model for all 2D string DP: define the state for prefixes of both strings, handle character match/mismatch cases, and build the table systematically.

The key insight is that if you can verify whether a candidate answer works in O(f(n)) time, and the answer space is monotonic (if k works, then k+1 also works or vice versa), you can binary search on the answer space in O(f(n) × log(range)) time. This pattern appears in problems like finding minimum capacity, maximum distance, or threshold values.",
      "Binary search on answer works by defining a range [low, high] for possible answers, then checking the middle value mid. You write a feasibility function that returns true if mid is a valid answer and false otherwise. If mid works, you know the optimal answer is at most mid, so you search [low, mid]. If mid doesn't work, the answer must be larger, so you search [mid+1, high]. The final answer is the smallest (or largest, depending on the problem) value that passes the feasibility check.",

The array still has sorted portions, and you can identify which half is properly sorted by comparing arr[left] with arr[mid]. If the left half is sorted (arr[left] <= arr[mid]), you check if the target lies within that sorted range. If yes, search there; otherwise, search the right half. This requires careful condition checking to avoid off-by-one errors and handle duplicates.",
      "Finding first and last occurrences of a target in a sorted array with duplicates requires two separate binary searches. For the first occurrence, when you find the target at mid, you don't return immediately but continue searching the left half to see if there's an earlier occurrence: right = mid - 1. For the last occurrence, you search the right half: left = mid + 1. The final answer for first occurrence is left, and for last occurrence is right. This pattern extends to finding lower_bound and upper_bound used in many competitive programming problems.",
      "Peak element problems ask you to find an element that is greater than its neighbors. Even though the array is not fully sorted, binary search works because you can make local decisions: if arr[mid] < arr[mid+1], a peak must exist in the right half (since the sequence is increasing). If arr[mid] > arr[mid+1], a peak must exist in the left half or at mid itself. This works even with multiple peaks because you only need to find one peak, not all of them.",
      "Searching in 2D sorted matrices can be done in O(log(m × n)) by treating the matrix as a flattened sorted array. Map 1D index to 2D coordinates: row = mid / n, col = mid % n. Alternatively, use a staircase search starting from top-right or bottom-left, moving left if the current element is too large or down if it's too small. This takes O(m + n) but is simpler to implement and works even when rows are sorted but columns are not.",
      "Real-world applications of advanced binary search include: allocating server resources (minimize maximum load), cutting materials to minimize waste (maximize minimum piece length), scheduling jobs with deadlines (minimize maximum completion time), and rate limiting (find maximum request rate that doesn't overload). Any optimization problem where you can verify a solution but not directly compute it may be solvable with binary search on the answer.",
      "Common pitfalls include forgetting to handle edge cases like empty arrays, single elements, or all duplicates. Also, be careful with the feasibility function: it must correctly implement the monotonic property. If the function is buggy, binary search will give wrong answers silently. Always test your feasibility function separately on boundary cases before integrating it with binary search. Trace through a small example by hand to verify correctness.",

The greedy strategy is to always pick the activity that ends earliest, because this leaves the most room for future activities.

For jump game II (minimum jumps), track the current jump boundary and increment jumps when you need to extend the boundary.",

The greedy strategy is to sort items by value-to-weight ratio and take items in that order until the capacity is full, possibly taking a fraction of the last item.

      "Real-world greedy algorithm applications include: task scheduling on processors (minimize idle time), Dijkstra's shortest path (greedily pick nearest unvisited node), Prim's minimum spanning tree (greedily add cheapest edge), load balancing (assign jobs to least loaded server), and caching strategies (evict least recently used item). Many operating system schedulers, network routing protocols, and resource allocators use greedy heuristics for efficiency even when optimal solutions are intractable.",
      "Proving greedy correctness requires showing that the greedy choice is safe (doesn't block future optimal choices) and that after making the greedy choice, the remaining problem has the same structure. Often you prove by exchange argument: assume an optimal solution differs from the greedy choice, then show you can exchange elements to transform it into the greedy solution without worsening it, contradicting optimality. Not all optimization problems have greedy solutions; recognizing when greedy works vs. when DP is needed is a crucial skill.",
      "Common mistakes include applying greedy to problems that need DP (like 0/1 knapsack or longest increasing subsequence), forgetting to sort the input when the greedy strategy depends on order, and choosing the wrong greedy criteria (e.g., picking shortest interval instead of earliest ending interval). Always question: does my greedy choice preserve optimality? Can I construct a counterexample where greedy fails? Test on edge cases like all elements equal, single element, or extreme values to validate your approach."

      "Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems by incrementally building candidates and abandoning a candidate (backtracking) as soon as it determines the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution. It is essentially a depth-first search of the solution space with pruning. Backtracking is used when you need to explore all possibilities but can eliminate many branches early by checking constraints, making it much faster than brute force.",
      "The template for backtracking involves three components: a choice at each step, constraints that define valid choices, and a goal that defines a complete solution. The recursive structure is: if goal reached, save solution; otherwise, for each valid choice, make the choice, recurse to the next step, then undo the choice (backtrack). This undo step is crucial—it restores the state so you can explore the next choice. Without proper backtracking, you would be exploring with corrupted state.",
      "Subsets (generating all subsets of a set) is the simplest backtracking problem. At each element, you have two choices: include it or exclude it. The recursion tree has 2^n leaves, one for each subset. The template is: at position i, you either add nums[i] to the current subset and recurse to i+1, or skip nums[i] and recurse to i+1. When i reaches n, you've made a choice for all elements, so you save the current subset. This generates all 2^n subsets in O(n × 2^n) time (n to copy each subset).",
      "Permutations (all arrangements of elements) requires tracking which elements have been used. A common approach is to maintain a used array, and at each recursion level, try adding each unused element, mark it as used, recurse, then unmark it. Alternatively, use a swap-based approach: swap the current position with each position from current to end, recurse, then swap back. Both generate all n! permutations in O(n × n!) time. Permutations with duplicates require sorting and skipping duplicate choices to avoid generating the same permutation multiple times.",
      "Combinations (choose k elements from n) can be solved by backtracking with a start index to avoid choosing the same element twice and to ensure combinations rather than permutations. At each level, try adding elements from start to n, recurse with start+1, then remove the element. When the current combination has k elements, save it. This generates C(n, k) combinations. Combination sum problems add a target constraint: only recurse if the current sum doesn't exceed the target, and you can reuse elements by recursing with the same index.",
      "N-Queens places n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. For each row, try placing a queen in each column, check if it's safe (no other queen in the same column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal), recurse to the next row, then remove the queen. The constraint checking is the key optimization: maintain sets of occupied columns, diagonals (row - col), and anti-diagonals (row + col) for O(1) conflict checking. Without these, checking safety would be O(n) making the algorithm much slower.",
      "Sudoku solver fills a 9×9 grid following Sudoku rules. For each empty cell, try digits 1-9, check if the digit is valid in the current row, column, and 3×3 box, place it, recurse to the next empty cell, and backtrack if the recursion fails. The key optimization is choosing the order of cells to fill: filling cells with fewer possibilities first (most constrained first) prunes the search tree more effectively. Some implementations precompute possible digits for each cell to speed this up.",
      "Word search in a 2D grid checks if a word exists by trying to form it starting from each cell. For each cell, if it matches the first letter, mark it as visited, recursively search the four neighbors for the next letter, then unmark it. The visited marking prevents using the same cell twice in one path. This is backtracking because you undo the visited mark after the recursion returns, allowing the cell to be used in different paths. Time complexity is O(m × n × 4^L) where L is the word length, but pruning reduces this significantly in practice.",
      "Backtracking optimization techniques include: pruning (stop early when constraints violated), choosing the most constrained variable first, memoization (cache results of subproblems if they repeat), and iterative deepening (limit recursion depth and increase gradually). For combinatorial problems, the search space grows exponentially, so even small optimizations can make the difference between feasible and infeasible runtime. Always look for opportunities to prune: if the current partial solution can't possibly lead to a valid complete solution, backtrack immediately.",
      "Common mistakes in backtracking include forgetting to undo choices (causing incorrect state in later branches), not handling base cases properly (leading to infinite recursion or missing solutions), and inefficient constraint checking (making the algorithm too slow). Always test on small inputs where you can manually verify all solutions. Backtracking is a powerful technique, but it's also easy to get wrong, so careful implementation and testing are essential. Visualizing the recursion tree helps understand the flow and debug issues."

      "Bit manipulation uses bitwise operators to perform operations on individual bits of numbers. Computers store data in binary, so bit-level operations are extremely fast. Common bitwise operators are AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>). Understanding these operators and recognizing when to use them can lead to elegant solutions that are faster and use less memory than conventional approaches.",
      "The XOR operator (^) has useful properties: x ^ 0 = x, x ^ x = 0, and XOR is commutative and associative. These properties make XOR perfect for finding elements that appear an odd number of times. For example, to find the single number in an array where every other number appears twice, XOR all numbers together: the pairs cancel out, leaving only the single number. This works in O(n) time and O(1) space, much better than using a hash map.",
      "Bit masks allow you to represent a set using an integer where each bit indicates whether an element is present. For example, the set {0, 2, 5} can be represented as the binary number 100101 (bits 0, 2, and 5 are set). You can add element i with mask |= (1 << i), remove it with mask &= ~(1 << i), check if it's present with (mask & (1 << i)) != 0, and toggle it with mask ^= (1 << i). This is space-efficient for small sets and enables fast subset enumeration.",
      "Generating all subsets using bit manipulation is elegant: for a set of n elements, there are 2^n subsets, which can be represented by integers from 0 to 2^n - 1. For each integer i, the bits of i indicate which elements are in the subset. Iterate i from 0 to 2^n - 1, and for each i, check each bit j to see if element j is included. This is equivalent to backtracking but uses iteration instead of recursion, and it's easier to understand once you grasp the bit pattern concept.",
      "Counting bits (number of 1s in binary representation) is a common operation. The naive approach checks each bit with (n & (1 << i)). A faster trick is Brian Kernighan's algorithm: n & (n - 1) clears the rightmost 1 bit. Repeat until n becomes 0, counting the iterations. For example, 12 (1100) & 11 (1011) = 8 (1000), then 8 & 7 = 0. This takes O(number of 1s) instead of O(log n). Modern CPUs have built-in popcount instructions that count bits in O(1).",
      "Checking if a number is a power of two can be done with a single bit trick: n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0. Powers of two have exactly one 1 bit in binary (1, 10, 100, 1000, ...). Subtracting 1 flips all bits after that 1 bit, so ANDing them gives 0. For example, 8 (1000) & 7 (0111) = 0. This is much faster than using logarithms or division. Similarly, checking if a number is a power of four can be done with additional checks on bit positions.",
      "Swapping two numbers without a temporary variable uses XOR: a ^= b, b ^= a, a ^= b. After the first operation, a = a ^ b. After the second, b = (a ^ b) ^ b = a. After the third, a = (a ^ b) ^ a = b. This is a classic bit trick, though modern compilers optimize regular swaps well, so it's more of a curiosity than a practical optimization. However, XOR swap is useful in certain scenarios like swapping adjacent elements in an array in-place.",
      "Real-world applications include: network subnet masks (IP address ranges), permission systems (each bit represents a permission), graphics (color manipulation, alpha blending), compression (Huffman coding uses bit streams), cryptography (XOR in stream ciphers), and databases (bitmap indexes for fast queries). Many low-level systems and performance-critical code use bit manipulation extensively. Understanding bits is essential for systems programming and competitive programming.",
      "Advanced bit tricks include: finding the rightmost 1 bit with n & -n (two's complement makes -n flip all bits and add 1), isolating bits with masks, and using bit DP for subset problems (like traveling salesman with bitmask DP). These techniques are not just for puzzles; they appear in real algorithms like hash functions, Bloom filters, and efficient set operations. Mastering bit manipulation opens up a new dimension of problem-solving.",
      "Common mistakes include sign issues (right shift behaves differently for signed vs unsigned), off-by-one errors in bit positions (forgetting bits are 0-indexed), and incorrect precedence (& has lower precedence than ==, so (n & 1 == 0) is parsed as (n & (1 == 0)) which is wrong; use ((n & 1) == 0)). Always use parentheses to clarify bitwise expressions. Test bit manipulation code with small numbers where you can manually verify the binary representation."

      "2-SAT Problem: Given boolean variables and clauses of form (a OR b), determine if there's an assignment satisfying all clauses. Each clause has exactly 2 literals (hence '2-SAT'). Example: (x1 OR x2) AND (¬x1 OR x3) AND (¬x2 OR ¬x3). NP-complete for 3+ literals, but polynomial for 2!",

      "Heavy Child Selection: For each node, mark edge to child with largest subtree as 'heavy', others as 'light'. Heavy child is unique per node. This creates heavy paths (chains of heavy edges). Light edges connect different heavy paths. Total heavy paths ≤ n.",
      "Path Decomposition: Every path from root to any node crosses at most O(log n) heavy paths (since each light edge halves subtree size). Query on path becomes O(log n) segment queries, each in O(log n) → total O(log² n) per query!",
      "DFS Decomposition: First DFS computes subtree sizes. Second DFS assigns chain IDs: when visiting heavy child, stay in same chain; when crossing light edge, start new chain. Maintain chain head, position in chain, and parent chain for each node.",
      "Segment Tree Integration: Map each heavy path to contiguous segment in array, store in segment tree. Path query becomes: jump up heavy paths toward LCA, querying segment tree for each path segment. Handle path split at LCA carefully.",
      "Path Queries: For path u→v, decompose into u→LCA(u,v) and v→LCA(u,v). For each path, jump up heavy chains, querying segment tree at each. Combine results (sum, max, min, etc.). Works for any associative operation on edges/nodes.",
      "Updates: Point update on node → update in segment tree at node's position in O(log n). Edge update similar. Range updates on paths possible but complex. HLD primarily shines for point updates + path queries.",
      "Applications: LCA queries in O(log n), path sum/max/min, path modifications, subtree queries combined with path queries, distance queries, tree coloring problems. Very versatile for tree problems with online queries!"

      "Centroid: Node whose removal creates components each ≤ n/2 size. Every tree has at least one centroid (at most two). Finding centroid: DFS to compute subtree sizes, pick node where all components ≤ n/2. O(n) to find centroid of tree.",

      "Distance Queries: Precompute distance from each centroid to all nodes in its component. For dist(u,v), try all common ancestors in decomposition tree, compute dist(u,c) + dist(c,v) for each centroid c. Minimum is answer. O(log² n) per query.",
