## Project Overview

AlgoSort is a web application for learning Data Structures & Algorithms through
organized tutorials and curated LeetCode problems.  
The app currently runs entirely from the **React frontend**.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Styling: CSS (Midnight / dark theme)
- Backend (optional / not required for current usage): Django

## Backend Status (Important)

This repository contains a **Django backend**, but it is **not required to run
the app in its current state**.

- All tutorials and problems are loaded from static JSON files in the frontend.
- No user accounts, database, or server-side logic are needed yet.
- You can run the project using **only the frontend**.
